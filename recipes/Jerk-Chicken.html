    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Jamaican Jerk Chicken is well-seasoned grilled chicken with Jamaican jerk marinade that has the perfect balance of heat and sweetness</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Whole Chicken</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
            <li>Jerk Seasoning</li>
            <li>Onion Powder</li>
            <li>Garlic Powder</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Prep the chicken. Trim chicken of excess fat and pat dry with a cloth or paper napkin.</li>
          <li>Season and set aside. Rub with salt and freshly ground pepper, jerk seasoning, garlic powder, and onion powder. Set aside while you make the marinade.</li>
          <li>Pulse until blended. In a food processor or blender, combine the following: thyme, green onions, garlic, ginger, habanero pepper. Pulse for about 30 seconds until blended. </li>
          <li>Soak the chicken. Soak the chicken with a mixture of soy sauce, brown sugar, allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, chicken bouillon powder, and water or pineapple juice, and then add the blended herbs and seasonings to complete the jerk marinade.</li>
          <li>Prep to refrigerate. Drench the chicken with jerk marinade, place in a zip lock bag and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, preferably overnight. Try not to touch the jerk blend with your hands because it is extremely spicy hot. If possible, use gloves.</li>
          <li>Prep to grill. When ready to grill, remove chicken from the jerk marinade and place on medium to high lightly oiled grill. Reserve the remaining marinade.</li>
          <li>Start grilling. Cook chicken on the prepared grill for 12- 20 minutes, until juices run clear with an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, turning often to optimize cooking and browning. You may also broil or roast the chicken in a hot oven (425 degrees F)</li>
          <li>Simmer and serve. In a small saucepan simmer the remaining marinade and the one from the chicken for about 7 minutes. Serve with the chicken or mix it before serving with the plantains.</li>  
        </ol>
